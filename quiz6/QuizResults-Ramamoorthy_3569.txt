Quiz May 4, Spring 2020   (c) DL, UTA, 2020


  C&P means cut and paste only those relevant lines from your program(s) into this quiz.


 1.  I understand that I am on my honor during this quiz, I will not collaborate, use 
     non-allowed sources, and I will not discuss or share this quiz with anyone for the next 
     4 hours.
     You MAY: use Google to search, use previous source code, 
     YOU MAY NOT use:
     Email, Facebook, Hangouts, IM, chats, Skype or ANY other human connection.

     This is a timed test. Late tests will have points deducted for being late.
     Very late tests will not be graded.

     The second part of the test, you should electronically submit, you will need to copy and paste 
     only those lines of code to implement that part of the test, usually a few (two to eight) lines of code. 
     Place it immediately after the question.

     Submit this Quiz (renamed) with code cut and pasted, ONLY text. DO NOT submit zips, binaries, libraries,
     or anything other than text.

     When any parts(questions) are complete complete, submit this test, you may make multiple submissions.

 2. Get files from this same folder.
   
 3. Name your program/submission with your name and last digits of your ID.

 4. Using the cloud services provider, all functionality possible should be implemented on that provider.
    (Of course, displaying web pages through a browser and the user interface is "local")

 5. Show a web page and interface (which resides on the cloud provider) with your full name and 
    student ID in large font at the top of every web page dispayed (for this quiz)
    The cloud service provider is AWS (Amazon Web Services).

Show and submit code:

 5. Please read part 5. above, again.
    Note: Due to (rather obvious) conditions, anything you have running "locally", we can not see.
    If you do wish to submit anything that ONLY runs locally, please append your code after the question
    below, (same as for clod implementation code). 
    If appropriate, you are welcome to submit "screen shots", if they are in a "MS Word", (or compatible) format,
    or PDF. We can not read other formats.

 6. On the cloud provider you will "host" two web pages, one called "Set", the other called "Display". 
    The Set page will allow a user to set a start value (for example 0 or 1000000) and an Increment and a Decrement
    button (or check box or similar) where only Increment OR Decrement may be selected. 
    On the Display page, in either a different browser or a different tab, (perhaps on a different computer), 
    you will show the start value counting up (increment) or down (decrement). 
    Please also show time of day (in hours, minutes and seconds) in a large font at the top of the screen 
    (as well as your name and student ID)
    Also on the Display page, show a "reset" button (on that web page) where we can reset the counter value 
    to zero ("0") (put anywhere on the page).
    Please DO NOT combine these two web pages into one, you may have links that go from one page to the other, 
    or if you wish have a third page that links to these two (Set and Display).

Set :
           <div>
                        Input a start value:
                        <input type = "number" name = "startvalue">
                        <br>
                        Increment: 
                        <input type="radio" name="change" value="add">
                        <br>
                        Decrement:
                        <input type="radio" name="change" value="minus">
                        <br>
                    <button type = "submit" formtarget = "_blank">Submit</button>
                </div>
            </form>
        </div>
    </body>
    <script>
        var title = document.getElementById("title");
        var current = new Date();
        var time = "Time: " + current.getHours() + ":" + current.getMinutes() + ":" + current.getSeconds();
        document.getElementById("time").innerHTML = time;

    </script>


Display :

<body>
<br>
            <h1><p id="demo"></p></h1>
            <p id="demo1"></p>

            <script>
var today = new Date();
var time = today.getHours() + ":" + today.getMinutes() + ":" + today.getSeconds();
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = time;
</script>

<br>
    
<div class="container">
  <h1><div id="counter"></div></h1>
  <button onclick="res()">Reset counter</button>
  <script language="JavaScript">
    let counter = document.getElementById('counter');
    let count = -1


    var count_event = setInterval(myCounter, 300);


    function res() {
      count = 0;
    }


    function myCounter() {
      count += 1;
      counter.innerHTML = count.toString();
    }


    function myTimer() {
      var d = new Date();
      time.innerHTML = d.toLocaleTimeString();
    }
  </script>

 7. Please import the data from the file "v.csv" into a relational table/data base. Then you will create a web
    interface to allow someone to enter either (you will implement both, a user will chose option 1 or 2): 
 
1. a "Number" (the first column, a volcano number) and you will show the Volcano Name, Latitude and Longitude
       for that number (if one exists), and allow a user to modify (change) the Volcano Name
    
@application.route("/volcanocheck", methods=["POST", "GET"])
def volcanocheck():

    vno = int(request.form['vno'])

    start_time = time.time()

    sql1 = "SELECT VolcanoName, Latitude, Longitude FROM volcano WHERE Num= '" + str(vno) +"'"
    cursor.execute(sql1)
    rows = cursor.fetchall()

    if rows is not None:
        pass

    end_time = time.time()
    elapsed_time = end_time-start_time

    return render_template("volcanocheck.html", rows=rows,rowcount=len(rows),elapsed_time=elapsed_time)

@application.route("/volcanoupdate", methods=["POST", "GET"])
def volcanoupdate():

    vno = int(request.form['vno'])
    newname = request.form['newname']

    sql1 = "UPDATE volcano set VolcanoName= '"+str(newname)+"'' WHERE Num= '" + str(vno) +"'"
    cursor.execute(sql1)
    sql10 = "COMMIT"
    cursor.execute(sql10)

    sql2 = "SELECT VolcanoName, Latitude, Longitude FROM volcano WHERE Num= '" + str(vno) +"'"
    cursor.execute(sql2)
    rows = cursor.fetchall()

    return render_template("volcanoupdate.html", rows=rows,rowcount=len(rows))



2. A "bounding box" ("upper left hand", or corner, Latitude and Longitude, then opposite corner "lower right hand",
       Latitude and Longitude) (that is a pair of (Latitude, Longitude) values, such as ((1, 10), (100, 120)), and you will 
       display Number, Country, Latitude and Longitude for all volcanos within that area (bounding box).

@application.route('/box', methods=['POST'])
def box():
    latitude1 = request.form['latitude1']
    longitude1 = request.form['longitude1']
    latitude2 = request.form['latitude2']
    longitude2 = request.form['longitude2']
    start_time = time.time()
    query1 = "SELECT * from volcano where Latitude BETWEEN '"+ latitude1 + "' AND  '"+ latitude2 + "' AND Longitude BETWEEN '"+ longitude1 +"' AND '"+ longitude2 + "'"
    cursor.execute(query1)
    rows = cursor.fetchall()
    end_time = time.time()
    elapsed_time = end_time-start_time

    return render_template('box.html',rows=rows, rowcount=len(rows),elapsed_time=elapsed_time)

3. Similar to part 6, we would like to have two browser tabs open so that we may modify a value in part 1, on one tab,
       then see it change (when refreshed, or better, automatically) on the other tab.

	SHOWN

 8.  When you are finished with any part, please submit a link (a link to your AWS app) 
     to Teams, and we will try to demo it, then when you are FINISHED 
     (or at the end of the class) please submit code to Teams, and terminate your app.

 Good Luck!
